Rate My Data
=====================

Trying to find holes in your data coverage? Wondering if other carriers have better data coverage and performance than yours? Want to know if others with your carrier are getting better performance on another device? If you said yes to any of those, you need Rate My Data!

Most mobile carriers show their data coverage of the entire country on a picture the size of a postage stamp. You're lucky to be able to pick out your city, let alone your home or office. And are those areas consistently served? Wouldn't it be nice to see where and when you had lousy connection on a map from an independent source?

## How does it work?

Rate my Data runs in the background, checking your network connectivity and performance. It anonymously keeps track of your data connection history, and allows you to see trouble spots or times.

You are helping to crowd-source a big data collection of device and carrier performance, so you can see if it's time to switch to greener pastures or stick with your current setup.

## I'm paranoid, are you tracking me?

Trust me, Google, Apple and the NSA know all there is to know about your movements. All we track is an anonymous unique ID. We don't know who you are, just what device you're on and your carrier. That way we can compile what devices and what carriers perform in different locations and different times.

## I'm super paranoid, can I not participate in the data tracking?

Sure, you can opt out of the anonymous collection and store all your network history locally on your device. It will keep your personal history, but not communicate it anywhere else. You won't be able to see your peers or other carrier's performance though.
